This project is to create a framework of Smart Contracts that would work on top of ERC20 token standard of Ethereum in order to ensure that ICO are regulated.

Smart contracts would be devised in such a way that the resulting token sale would meet all regulatory standards of the country in which the ICO is taking palce. This means that the creator of ICO would have to comply with all norms of the regulatory authority.


Some basic priciples that would be common in all ICOs follwing this regulation are as follws:

1)All the fund that is raised in token sale would be stored in a unique multisig wallet. These funds can only be withdrawn after a consensus of approval from all the stake holders of ICO.

2)The value of vote will be propotional to amount of tokens that the voter has and also the amount contributed in token sale.

3)After approval the funds would be available at  disposal to operator / Financial Head of ICO issuing company.
